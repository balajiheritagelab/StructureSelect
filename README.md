## Overview

Structural System Selector is a fully open-source, browser-based analytical tool designed to assist undergraduate architecture students in selecting appropriate structural systems during the conceptual design stage.

The application uses a weighted multi-criteria decision matrix to evaluate structural systems based on:

- Span requirements  
- Building height  
- Material preference  
- Architectural expression  
- User-defined importance weights  

It is intended as an educational decision-support tool — not as a structural design calculator.

## Key Features

- Multi-criteria weighted scoring system  
- Transparent ranking of structural systems  
- Adjustable importance weights  
- Mobile-browser compatible  
- Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript  
- No frameworks, no libraries  
- 100% free and open-source  
- Deployable via GitHub Pages  
- Works offline  

---

## Target Users

- Undergraduate architecture students  
- Studio design projects  
- Concept stage feasibility studies  
- Introductory structural systems courses  

---

## How It Works

The system evaluates each structural typology using a weighted decision matrix:

Score = Σ (Closeness to requirement × User-defined weight)

Each system is compared against project inputs across:

- Span compatibility  
- Height suitability  
- Material alignment  
- Architectural expression  

The systems are ranked in descending order of total weighted score.

## Disclaimer

This tool provides conceptual guidance only.

It does NOT:

- Perform structural analysis  
- Replace professional structural engineering design  
- Verify safety, code compliance, or load calculations  

All structural decisions for built projects must be validated by qualified structural engineers.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed using:

- GitHub Pages  
- Any static web hosting platform  
- Local browser execution (offline compatible)

No backend or server is required.
